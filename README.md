# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation for this webpage is to provide a reflection of the steps taken to get ready for a fullstack coding bootcamp.
This study guide is a reflection of the steps taken to learn the basics of VS Code, Terminal, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The problem this solves is for me to have some basic knowledge of how to use GitHub to create projects.  It taught me how to create a local environment to work on code without having to mess with the main project.  It also taught me how to stage, commit, and pull updates(changes) into the main branch of GitHub with changes to the code.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide was developed for boot camp students who were going through prework to get ready for the bootcamp. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It showed us how in DevTools console, we have the ability to see JavaScript running. It will list the topics that we covered and learned from the prework.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
